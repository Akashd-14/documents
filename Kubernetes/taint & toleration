Taints:
  Taints are applied to nodes in a Kubernetes cluster to repel pods from being scheduled on those nodes.
  Each taint consists of three parts
    1 Key: The key represents the name of the taint and is used to uniquely identify it.
    2 Value: An optional value associated with the taint key.
    3 Effect: The effect determines how the taint affects pod scheduling.

There are three values for the effect:

1 NoSchedule:
    Prevents new pods from being scheduled on the tainted node.
    
2 PreferNoSchedule:
    PreferNoSchedule is a "preference" or "soft" version of NoSchedule
    Similar to NoSchedule, but the scheduler tries to avoid placing new pods on the tainted node unless necessary.
    
3 NoExecute:
    This affects pods that are already running on the node.
    It Evicts existing pods that do not tolerate the taint.

1 Add a taint to a node 
  kubectl taint nodes <node-name> <key>=<value>:<effect>

2 Remove the taint added to node
  kubectl taint nodes <node-name> <key>=<value>:<effect>-

Tolerations:
  Tolerations are applied to pods and indicate that the pod can be scheduled on nodes with specific taints.
  Tolerations allow the scheduler to schedule pods with matching taints.
  A pod with toleration will only be scheduled on nodes that have a matching taint.
  The default value for operator is Equal.
  A toleration "matches" a taint if the keys are the same and the effects are the same
  the operator is Exists (in which case no value should be specified), or
  the operator is Equal and the values should be equal.

  tolerations:
  - key: "key"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "value1"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
  
  tolerations:
  - key: "key1"
    operator: "Exists"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
