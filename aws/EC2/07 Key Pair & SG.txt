## Key Pair ##
	It is a set of security credentials that we use to prove our identity when connecting to an Amazon EC2 instance.
	When we launch an instance we create a pair of keys one is public key & 2nd key is private key which is credential to connect to the server.
	Amazon EC2 stores the public key on our instance, and provide private key to user, so he can access server using this key.
	It's important that we store our private key in a secure place because anyone who possesses our private key can connect to our instances that use the key pair.
	For Linux instances, the private key allows us to securely SSH into our instance. 
	For Windows instances, the private key is required to decrypt the administrator password, which we then use to connect to our instance.
	To save the private key in a format that can be used with OpenSSH, we choose pem.
	To save the private key in a format that can be used with PuTTY, we choose ppk.
	
## Security Group ##
	A security group acts as a virtual firewall for our EC2 instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic.
	Inbound rules control the incoming traffic to our instance, and outbound rules control the outgoing traffic from our instance. 
	When we launch an instance, you we specify one or more security groups.
	They are fundamental of network security in AWS.
	They control how traffic allowed into or out of our EC2 instance.
	Security group only contains rules.
	Security groups can be reference by IP or another security group.
	By default EC2 associates our instance with a security group that allows no inbound traffic, we can create security group that allows our EC2 instance to accept certain traffic.

## They regulate
	Access to port
	Authorized IP ranges - IPV4 & IPV6
	Control of inbound network (other > Instance)
	Control of outbound network (Instance > other)
	We can attach to multiple instances at a time.
	They are locked down to a region / VPC combination i.e. we need to re-created security group for different regions and VPC combination.
	If our application is not accessible (time out error) then it is a security group issue.
	All inbound traffic is blocked by default.
	All outbound traffic is authorized by default.
	
Some Security group rules:-

1) Web server rules
	80 (HTTP) - access unsecurred websites.
	443 (HTTPS) - access secured websites.

2) Rules to connect to instance from our computer
	22 (SSH)(secure shell) - Log into a linux instance
	3389 (RDP) (Remote Desktop Protocol) - Log into windows instances.

3) Database server rules:-
	1433 (MS SQL) - To access microsoft SQL Server.
	3306 (MYSQL/ Aurora) - Access MYSOL / Aurora Database.
	5439 (Redshift) - Access Amazon Redshift cluster Database
	5432 (PostgresoL) - Access a postgresel Database.
	1521 (Orade) - Access an Oracle Database.

4) Amazon EFS rules:-
	2049 (NFS) (Network File System) - access biles over a network like they access local storage (53)
	21 (FTP)(File Transfer Protocol) - uploads files into a file share
