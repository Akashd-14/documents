## Amazon machine image (AMI)

	An AMI is supported and maintained image provided by AWS that provides the information required to launch an instance.
	We must specify an AMI when we launch an instance.
	We can launch multiple instances from single AMI when we require multiple instances with same configuration.
	We can use different AMI's to launch instances when we require instances with different configurations.
	
	It includes the following 
		1) One or more Amazon EBS snapshot or for instance store blocked AMI's a template for root volume of the instance.
		2) Launch permission that control which aws accounts can use the AMI to launch instance.
		3) A block device mapping that specifies the volume to attach to the instance when it is launched.
		4) Operating system
		5) Processor architecture
		
## AMI Types
	
	1) Quick Start AMIs (46)
		 Provided by AWS
		 Commonly used AMIs

	2) My AMIs
		Created by own or by an organization for personal use

	3) AWS Marketplace AMIs (11061)
		AWS & trusted third-party AMIs
		
	4) Community AMIs (500)
		Published by anyone
	
	Ami's are a customization of an EC2 instance.
		1) We add our own software configuration operating system and monitoring etc.
		2) Faster boot/configuration time because of all our softwares are pre packaged.
	
	Ami's are built for specific region and can be copied across multiple regions.
	We can launch EC2 instances from
		1) A public AMI i.e. provided by AWS.
		2) Our own AMI i.e. we make and maintain them ourself.
		3) An marketplace AMI i.e. an ami someone else made and potentially made.
		
## Ami Process (From an EC2 instance)
	1) Create an EC2 instance and customise it.
	2) stop instance for (data migration).
	3) Create an AMI it will also create EBS snapshot.
	4) Launch instances from created AMI.
	
## EC2 sizing and configuration option:-
	It has following configurations
	
		1) Operating systems:- Linux, Windows, Mac OS, Ubuntu etc.
		2) Compute Power and cores (cpu)
		3) Random Access Memory (RAM)
		4) Storage space:-
			network attached (EBS and EFS)
			Hardware (EC2 instance storage)
		5) Network card:- speed of the card, public ip address
		6) Firewall rules:- security group
		7) Bootstrap script:- EC2 user data (configure at first launch)
		
## EC2 user data:-
	It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 user data script.
	Bootstrapping means launching command when a machine star.
	That script is only run once at the instance first start.
	EC2 user data script runs with the root user only. 
	EC2 user data is used to automate boot task such as
		Installing updates
		Installing softwares
		Download common files from Internet
		Anything we can think of
