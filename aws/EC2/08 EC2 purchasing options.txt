## EC2 instance purchasing option 
	Amazon EC2 provide the following purchasing option to enable we to optimize our cost based on our needs
	
1) On-Demand Instances:-
	Pay for what we use. 
	Linux billing per second, after the first Minute
	All other operating systems billing per hour
	It has highest cost, but no upfront payment.
	No long term commitment.
	We use these instances for application with short term, irregular workload that cannot be interrupted.
	We have full control over its lifecycle i.e. we decide when to start, launch, stop, hibernate, reboot or terminate it.
	
2) EC2 Reserved Instances:-
	They provide with significant saving on our Amazon EC2 cost compared to on demand instance pricing.
	These are not physical instances, but rather billing discount applied to the use of on-demand instances in our account.

	Reservation period:-
		1 year 	=	+discount
		3 years =	3+discount
	Purchasing option:-
		No upfront/partial upfront 	= +discount
		all upfront					= 2+discount
	It reserves a specific instance type
	Recommended for steady state usage application (thick database).
	They have two types of class:-

	They are not suitable for critical jobs and databases.

4) EC2 Dedicated Host:-
	It is a physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to our use.
	They can help to address compilance requirements and reduce cost by allowing to use our existing server-bound software licences, pre-socket, pre-cover or per VM software licences, including windows servers, Microsoft Sql Server, SUSE and Linux Enterprises Server.
	They allocated for our account for a 3 years period reservation And they are more expensive.
	Useful for software that have complicated licencing model BYOL (bring our own licence) or for companies that have strong regularity or compliance needs.
	
5) EC2 Dedicated Instances:-
	These are Amazon EC2 instances that run in a virtual private cloud (VPC) on hardware that is dedicated to a single customer.
	They belongs to different AWS accounts are physically isolated at a hardware level, even if those accounts are linked to a single payer account.
	They might share hardware with other instances from the same AWS account.
	No control over instance placement (can move hardware after stop/start).
	
6) Savings Plans:-
	Savings Plans offer a flexible pricing model that provides savings on AWS usage. We can save up to 72% on our AWS compute workloads.
	SageMaker Savings Plans provide us with lower prices for our Amazon SageMaker instance usage, regardless of our instance family, size, component, or AWS Region.
	Savings Plans provide savings beyond On-Demand rates in exchange for a commitment of using a specified amount of compute power (measured per hour) for a one or three year period.
	We can pay for our commitment using All upfront, Partial upfront, or No upfront payment options.
	We have two saving plans as below:-
		1) Compute Savings Plans:-

## Which purchasing option is right for me:-

1) On-Demand Instances:-
	It is like to coming and staying in a resort whenever we like, we pay the full price.

2) Reserved Instances:-
		It like planning ahead and if we plan to stay for a long time, we may get a good discount.
		
3) Spot Instances:-
	The hotel allow people to bid for the empty room and the highest bidder keeps the room.
	We can get kicked out at anytime.
	
4) Dedicated Host:-
	We book an entire building of the resort.
