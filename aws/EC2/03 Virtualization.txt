## What is virtualization?
	Virtualization is a process that allows a computer to share its hardware resources with multiple digitally separated environments.
	Each virtualized environment runs within its allocated resources such as memory, processing power and storage. 
	With virtualization, organizations can switch between different operating systems on the same server without rebooting. 
	Virtual machines and hypervisors are two important concepts in virtualization.

## Virtual machine
	A virtual machine is a software-defined computer that runs on a physical computer with a separate operating system and computing resources. 
	The physical computer is called the host machine and virtual machines are guest machines. 
	Multiple virtual machines can run on a single physical machine. 
	Virtual machines are abstracted from the computer hardware by a hypervisor.

## Hypervisor
	The hypervisor is a software component that manages multiple virtual machines in a computer.
	It ensures that each virtual machine gets the allocated resources and does not interfere with the operation of other virtual machines.
	
	There are two types of hypervisors.

		Type 1 hypervisor
			A type 1 hypervisor or bare-metal hypervisor, is a hypervisor program installed directly on the computerâ€™s hardware instead of the operating system.
			Therefore, type 1 hypervisors have better performance and are commonly used by enterprise applications.
			Kernel based Virtual Machine(KVM) uses the type 1 hypervisor to host multiple virtual machines on the Linux operating system.

		Type 2 hypervisor
			It is also known as a hosted hypervisor
			The type 2 hypervisor is installed on an operating system. 
			Type 2 hypervisors are suitable for end-user computing.
