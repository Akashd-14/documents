## Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

EC2 is the one of the most popular service of AWS provides virtual scalable computing capacity in AWS Cloud.
Using EC2 we can eliminates our need to invest in hardware upfront, so we can develop and deploy applications faster.
Using EC2 we can launch, stop or terminate our servers at any time as we need.
It is a resizeble service so we can scale up or csale down as per traffic flow.
It eleminate the cost of buying hardware servers and it's maintenance.
We can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as per our need, configure Security, networking & manage storage.
It is Infrastructure as a Service.
Mainly it consist in the capability of
	Rental virtual machines (EC2)
	Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
	Distributing load across machines (ELB)
	Scalling the service using an auto-scalling group (ASG)

## Features of Amazon EC2 :-
	It provides following features:

	1) Virtual computing environments known as instance.
	2) Preconfigured templates for our instance known as Amazen Machine Images (AMI), that packages the bits we need for our servers (include operating systore and additional software).
	3) Various configurations of CPU, memory storage & networking capacity fer our instance known as instance type.
	4) Secure login information for our instances using key pairs (AWS stores the puplic key & we store private ka in secure place).
	5) Storage volume for temporary data that is delected when we stop, hibernate or tearminate our instances. known as 'instance store volume.
	6) Persistent storage volumes for our data using Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS). known as Amazon EBS volume.
	7) Multiple physical locations for our resources such as instance and Amazon EBS volume known as Region & Availability zone
	8) A firewall that enables to specify the protocols, port and source IP range that can reach an instances using security group.
	9) Static IPv4 addresses for dynamic cloud computing, known as Elastic IP addresses.
	10) Metadata known as tags that we can create & assign to our EC2 instances / resources.
	11) Virtual networks we can create that are logically isolated from rest of Akis Cloud & that we can optionally connect to our own network, known Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
	
EC2 Instance Types:-
We can use diffrent types of EC2 instances that are optimised for different use cases.
Following are the types of EC2 instance:-
	1) General Purpose
	2) Compute Optimized
	3) memory optimized
	4) Accelerated Computing.
	5) Storage Optimized

Instance types comprise varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage & networking capacity & gives the flexibility to choose the appropriate mixture of resources for our application.
Each Instance type inclueles one or more instance size, allowing to scale our resources to the requirement of our target workload.

AWS has following naming convention :-

		m5.2xlarge
	here,
		m - Instance class.
		5 - Generation (AWS improves them over times)
		2xlarge - size within the instance class.	
		
1) General Purpose: -

• It provides a balance of compute, memory & networking resources & can be used for a variety of diverse workload.
• These instances are ideal for applications such as  a web servers & code repositories.
• It has following types:-
	1) Mac		2) T4g		3) T3		4) T3a		5) T2		6) M6g		7) M6i	
	8) M6a		9) M5		10) M5a		11) M5n		12) M5zn	13) M4		14) A1
	
2) Compute Optimized:-
	These instance are Ideal for compute bound application that benifit from high performance processor.
	Instances belonging to this family are well suited for batch processing workloads, media transcoding, high performance web servers, high performance computing (HPC), scientific modeling, dedicated gaming servers & ad server engines, machine learning.
	They are available in different types as follows:-
		1) C7g 2) C6g 3) C6gn 4) C6i 5) C6a 6) Hpc6a 7) C5 8) C5a 9) C5n 10) C4

3) Memory optimized:-
	These instances are designed for deliver fast performance for workloads that proccess large data set in memory.
	They are available in different types as below:-
		1) R69 2) R6i 3)R5 4)R5a 5) R5b 6) R5n 7) R4 8) x2gd 9) x2idn 10) x2iedn 11) x2iezn 12) X1e 13) X1 14) High memory 15) z1d

4) Accelerated computing:- 
	These instances are hardware accelerators, or co-processors to perform functions, such as floating point number calculations, graphics processing or data pattern maching, more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPU
	They have following types:-
		1) P4	2) P3	3) P2	4)DLI	5) Trn1 6) Inf1		7) G5	8) G5g	9) Gadn	10) G4ad
		
5) Storage Optimized:-
	These instances are designed for workloads that require high sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage. . They are optimized to deliver tons of thousands of low-latency, random I/O operations per sound (IOPS) to application
	They have following types:-
		1) Im4gn	2) Is4gn	3} 14i	4) I3	5) I3en	6) D2	7) D3	8) D3en	9) H1
