## Types Of Cloud Computing Models
## Layers of Cloud Computing

In general, Cloud Computing Models are widely classified into 4 types. They are as follows:

1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
	It is the basic layer of cloud computing.
	It provides scalable and virtualized computing resources like servers, storage, and networking over the internet.
	In this service, users can have full control over the infrastructure, having customization and management access of virtual machines, storage, and networking components.

2. PaaS (Platform as a Service)
	It provides a platform or a environment to build, deploy and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure.
	It offers tools and services such as development frameworks, databases and middleware streamlining the application development lifecycle.

3. SaaS (Software as a Service)
	SaaS elivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. 
	It eliminating the need for users to install, maintain, or update the software locally.
	With this service users can access the applications from any device with an internet connection, enabling flexibility and accessibility.

4. Serverless Computing
	Serverless computing provides abstracts for server management, facilitating users to focus completely on developing and deploying code without managing servers.
	It automatically scales the resources based on demand, reducing the operational and overhead costs, and enabling rapid development and deployment of applications.
	
Difference Between IaaS, PaaS, SaaS And Serverless
The following are the differences between IaaS, PaaS, SaaS and Serverless:

	Aspect				IaaS						PaaS						SaaS						Serverless Computing
	
Infrastructure	It provides virtualized		It provides the platform		It is used for fully		It provides an abstracted
				computing resources	 		for application development		developed software appl		server management

Management		Users manage virtual M/C	Platform provider manages		Vendor fully manages and	Developers focus only 
				storage, networking	 		underlying infrastructure		maintains the software		on writing code
				
Customization	High level of				Limited customization			Minimal customization		Focuses on code,
				customization	 			options														less on infrastructure

Flexibility		High						Moderate						Low							High

Scalability		Scalable at 				Scalable at application			Scalable at user			Automatically scales
				infrastructure level		level							level						based on demand

Examples		Amazon Web Services (AWS)	Google App Engine				Salesforce					AWS Lambda, Azure Functions,
