
## User Management in Linux

	A user is a person who utilizes a computer or network service.
	Linux is said to be secure because one user cannot access files of other user without its permission.
	Each user has assigned an ID that is unique for each user in the operating system.

There are three types of user:

1. System user:
	System accounts are used by the services in Linux system.
	These accounts or users generally created when services are installed in system.

2. Super user:
	Super users are those users who has all privileges of Linux system.
	On all Linux systems, by default there is the user root, also known as the super user.
	This account is used for managing Linux. It can also create other user accounts on the system.
	For some tasks root privileges are required. Some examples are installing software, managing users, and creating partitions on disk devices.

3. Standard user:
	Local user accounts or standard user accounts are for the people who need to work on a system and who need limited access of the resources on that system.
	These user accounts typically have a password that is used for authenticating the user to the system.

## Adding New User

	Adding new local user means creating user account.
	User can be added by root user or using root user’s privileges.
	Whenever new user has been added, some files get affected. These files holds user accounts related information.
	Also whenever new user is created, by default, its home directory has been generated.
	
	useradd <username>		#### Create user account.
	adduser <username>

Files affected by newly added user:
	/etc/passwd		## It store user profile related information,
	/etc/shadow		## It stores user password policies
	/etc/group		## It store group information.
	/etc/gshadow	## Stores group password and member’s list.

## To modify user

	usermod <option> <parameter> username		####modify or changes exiting user acc.

	Options,
		-u		## to change user id
