
## Linux Prompt-

	The Linux command line is a text interface to our computer. Often referred to as the shell, terminal, console, prompt.
	The command prompt is an executable CLI program, cmd.exe
	The default prompt for many Linux distributions is often a string ending with the dollar sign ('$') for regular users and a hash ('#') for the root or superuser.
	The prompt typically includes information about the current user, hostname, and the current working directory.


##[user@hostname current_directory]$

	user: The current username.
	hostname: The name of the computer or server.
	current_directory: The path to the current working directory.
	$ or #: The prompt character, which is usually a dollar sign ('$') for regular users and a hash ('#') for the root user.
	
	Example - [akash@ip-172-12-20-44 home]$
	here	akash - username
			172-12-20-44 - private ip address/ hostname of the server
			home - current working directory name
			$ - it shows akash is the regular user

## Commands-

	Commands are case sensitive. (only small letters)
  
  General Syntax:
		[commands] -[options] -[argument]/[multiple arguments]
	here	
		Commands- To run the command.
		Options - To adjust behavior of the commands.

## sudo (Super User DO)- 
	Generally used as a prefix for some commands that only superusers are allowed to run.
	If you prefix any command with “sudo”, it will run that command with elevated privileges or in other words allow a user with proper permissions to execute a command as another user, such as the superuser. -
	This is the equivalent of the “run as administrator” option in Windows. The option of sudo lets us have multiple administrators.

## su (short for substitute or switch user) 
	allows us to run commands with another user’s privileges.
	using su is the simplest way to switch to the administrative account in the current login session.
