
We can create files using following commands:

cat	- We can only create a file

touch - It is used to create empty files

vi/vim/vm
nano		This are the editors.

## cat Command ##

	The cat command is one of the most universal tool yet all it does is copy standard input into standard output
	It display the content of files and concatenate file.
	It displaying the content of files and concatenating files, but we can use it in combination with input redirection to create a file with data.
	Name cat comming from "Concatenate file".
	
commands

cat > filename							## Create a file

cat filename							## Display the content of the file

cat filename1 filename2					## Display the content of two files together (concatenate)

cat >> filename							## Add new content in existing file

tac filename							## To see the content of the file in bottom to top format.

## touch Command ##

	Using touch command we can create multiple empty files at a time.
	Main function of the touch command is to update timestamp of file.
	Using touch command we can update only access time of the file & modify time of the file.
	
touch filename				## To create empty file

touch file1 file2 file3		## To createte multiple empty files
	
# Timestamp
	
	It is the time that shows when the file was created updated & when recently accessed.
	There are 3 types of timestamp as below
	
1) Access Time
	
	It shows that whenwas the file last time accessed or opened.
	we can update access time of the file using
	
touch -a filename

2) Modify Time

	It shows that last when the file was modified last time.
	We can change the modified time of the file using 
	
touch -m filename

3) Change Time

	It shows that last time when the file metadata was changed.
	It depends upon access time & modify time.
	It shows updated time between access time & modified time.

To get timestamp of a file we use

	stat filename
	
	o/p = access : Date		Time
		  modify : Date		Time
		  change : Date		Time
