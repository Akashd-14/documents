##Archiving and Compression ## 

## Archiving
	Archiving is the process of Bundling and Compression.
	Bundling is the process of combining multiple files and directories (same or different sizes) into one file/place.
	tar command is commonly used to bundle files and directories together into a single archive file.
	
	syntax
		
		tar <-options> <archive-fileName>.tar <files to be archived>

	options:
		-c 	-> create an archive.
		-f 	-> file name. (Compulsory option)
		-v 	-> verbose or view.
		-tf -> list the content from archive.
		-x 	-> execute the content from archive.
		-C 	-> copy content from an archive to another directory.
		
	Examples:
	
		tar -cvf archive.tar file1 file2 file3		## it combines file1,file2,file3 in a single file archive.tar
		
		tar -xvf archive.tar						## It extract archive.tar file in current directory & seperates file1,file2,file3
		
		tar -xvf archive.tar -C <path>				## It extract archive.tar file in mentioned path


## Compression

	Compression is the process of reducing the size of a file or directory.
	Compression is a reduction in the number of bits needed to represent data.
	Compressing data can save storage capacity, speed up file transfer and decrease costs for storage hardware and network bandwidth.

1)ZIP:

	syntax
		zip -r file.zip <fileName>		## compress the file
		unzip -r file.zip				## Extract the file
2)GZIP:
	GZIP is good option for compressing a lot of data as it is quick.
	Its memory usage is also low.
	GZIP compression can be used by using “-z” option in tar command or by using gzipcommand.
	GZIP compressed file can be extracted using gunzip.
	
	syntax
		gzip file.gz <fileName>	## compress the file
		gunzip file.gz			## To extract the file
		
3)BZIP2:
	BZIP2 provide better compression ratio compared to GZIP but require more "CPU time" to accomplish it.
	“-j” option in tar or bzip2 command can be used for bzip2 compression.
	Bunzip2 is command to extract bzip2 compressed file.
	
	syntax
		bzip2 file.bz2 <fileName>		## compress the file
		bunzip2  file.bz2				## Extract the file
		
4)XZ:
	XZ provide impressive compression ration but in cost of very high CPU and Memory usage.
	Decompression speed is better but it also consumes a lot of memory.
	XZ compression can be done by “-J” option in tar or xz command.
	
	syntax
		xz file.xz <fileName>		## compress the file
		unxz  file.xz			## Extract the file
		
	We can use compression command with archiving command by using below options and extensions
	
	No.	Name	Option		Extension		Unzip Command
	1	gzip	-z			.tar.gz				gunzip
	2	bzip2	-j			.tar.bz2			bunzip2
	3	xz		-J			.tar.xz				unxz
	
	Examples
		
		tar -cjvf file.tar.bz2 <files to be archived & compressed> 	## For archiving & compressing here we use j for bzip2
		
		tar -xJvf file.tar.xz										## For Extracting here we use J for xz command
