## ps(process status)
	It is used to list currently running processes.
	It provides information about these processes, such as their process ID (PID), terminal associated with the process, CPU and memory usage, and more.
	It provides a snapshot of the current processes on our system.

	syntax
	ps <options>
	
	a: This option shows all the running processes.
	e: This option displays information about every process on the system.
	f: This option generates a full listing, providing more details about the processes and their relationships.
	u: This option displays the owner of each process and additional information like CPU and memory usage.
	x: This option lists all processes regardless of whether they are associated with a terminal.
	aux: This option shows a detailed list of all processes running on the system, including those owned by other users.
	
## pstree
	It shows all running processes in a tree format.
	
	syntax:
	 pstree

## top
	top command is used to show the Linux processes.
	it provides dynamic real-time view of running system.
	usually, this command shows the summary information of the system and the list of processes or threads which are currently managed by the Linux Kernel.
	
	syntax
		top
		
## Adjust Process Priority
	When Linux processes are started, they are started with a specific priority.
	By default, all regular processes are equal and are started with the same priority, which is the priority number 0.
	In some cases, it is useful to change the default priority that was assigned to the process when it was started.
	We can do that using the nice and renice commands.
	the niceness value ranges from -20(highest prioprity) to 19(lowewst priority).

## nice command
	It's used to launch a new process with a specified niceness value.
	The niceness value ranges from -20(highest prioprity) to 19(lowewst priority).

	Syntax:
		nice <options> <command>
		Ex nice -n 10 command
		
## To check nice value:
	
	syntax:
		ps -l PID

## renice command
	used to change the niceness value of an existing process.
	to alter priority of running process, we use renice command.

	Syntax:
		renice <value> PID

## kill command
	It's used to terminate the process manually.
	kill command sends a signal to a process that terminates the process.

	Syntax:
		kill -<signal number> PID

	Three of these signals work for all processes :
		The signal SIGTERM (15) is used to ask a process to stop.
		The signal SIGKILL (9) is used to force a process to stop.
		The SIGHUP (1) signal is used to hang up a process.
