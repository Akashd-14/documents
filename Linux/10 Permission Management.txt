
### Permissions in Linux

	Linux File System Security restricts user to access the files and directories.
	User require permissions to access files or directories.
	“ls -l” or “ll” command can be used to check security of any file or directory.
	Above command will display contents from directory along with its security details.

	drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 May 9 18:41 Linux
	-rw-rw-r-- 1 root root 60582753 May 10 12:02 file1.txt

	The first character = ‘-‘ which means it’s a file, ‘d’ which means it’s a directory.
	The next nine characters = (rw-r–r–) show the security
	The number shows the symbolic link (1-file,other no.-directory) 
	The next column shows the owner of the file. (Here it is root)
	The next column shows the group owner of the file. (Here it is root which has special access to these files)
	The next column shows the size of the file in bytes.
	The next column shows the date and time the file was last modified.
	Last Column = File_name or Directory_name. (For example, here are: prac, snap, test, example)

## Types of file

1) Ordinary File/ Regular File (start with _)

	File which contain Data.
	Regular files are nothing but the everyday files used to store information such as text, or images.
	These files can be found in directories, which are yet another type of files.
	In Linux, regular files can exist with or without an extension.
	
2)Directory File (Start with d)
	
	Directory file is equal to folder, it contains files and folders.
	Directories are also Linux files. But rather than storing data, they store the location of other files. To achieve this, the directory uses directory entries. 

3) Link File (Start with l)

	A link is a symbolic connection or pointer to a single file that allows us to access it from more than one directory.
	We can set up a link to a file in a restricted directory, allowing access to the file without providing access to the directory.
	
	1) Soft link- 
		Link will be removed if original file removed.
		soft or symbolic link creates a pointer to the original file i.e. it creates shortcut of the file.
	
	Synatx to create softlink,
		ln –s <original_file> <softlink_name/path>
		
	2)Hard link
	
	A hard link develops a mirror copy of the original file.
	Renaming, deleting or removing original file will not effect link.

	Syntax to create hardlink,
		ln <original_file> <hardlink_name/path>

4) Named Pipe file (start with p)  

	used to establish two-way communications between two unrelated programs.
	Sends data from one process to another so that receiving process reads the data in FIFO manner.
	These files are present in /run folder.

5) Socket file (start with s)

	Special file to enable communications between two processes.
	These files are present in /run folder.

6) Character file (start with c)
	Reads and write data character by character.
	These files are present in /dev folder.
	A character device file is a hardware file that reads or writes data one character at a time in a file.

7) Block Device file (start with b)
	
	file that refers to device.
	a piece of hardware that provides data access in blocks

### Three types of permissions-

	1)Read (r):
	
		Allows reading and viewing the contents of a file or directory.

	2) Write (w):
		
		Grants the ability to modify, delete, or add to the contents of a file or directory.

	3)Execute (x):

		Enables the execution of a file or allows access to a directory's contents if used with directory permissions.

These permissions are set for three categories of users:

	1)Owner: (u)
		
		The user who owns the file or directory.

	2) Group: (g)

		Users who are members of the group associated with the file or directory.

	3) Others: (o)
	
		All other users who are not the owner or part of the group.

	All: (a)
	
		Permissions are represented by a series of symbols:
			r: indicates read permission.
			w: indicates write permission.
			x: indicates execute permission.
			-: indicates no permission.
			
### Symbols:

	+ Add permissions
	- Remove permissions
	= Set the permissions to the specified values
